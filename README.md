## Data Overview
- **34,937 records** of **164 countries**.
-   **72%** of the world’s electricity generation capacity

Each record contains:
- **Power plant details** (2013 to 2019):
-   geolocations
-   energy source
-   plant capacity
-   yearly actual and estimated energy generation
-   ownership

**Data Quality**
- **> 90% of plants in the US** reported energy generation data.
- **< 50% of plants for other countries** reported their energy generation data

## Executive Summary
The global energy sector is undergoing a significant transformation: increasing focus on renewable energy sources and sustainable practices. 

**Key challenges:**
- Uneven adoption of renewables across regions
- Compliance with emission standards
- Economic impact on economies.

**Goal:** To provide data-driven insights that support renewable energy investment, emission compliance, and economic impact analysis for informed decision-making by energy stakeholders.

## Business-Use Cases
**Identify regions leading in adding renewable energy sources over the past few years**
- Goal: Help policymakers identify thriving regions to replicate successful strategies in other areas and allocate resources more effectively.

**Identify CO₂ emissions for each energy fuel type**
- Goal: Identify energy fuel types that contribute the most to CO₂ emissions to strategize on transitioning to cleaner, low-emission alternatives.

**Analyze the economic contribution of power plants by fuel type in terms of employment.**
- Goal: Identify the fuel types generating the most employment


## Extract, Transform and Load (ETL)
#### Extract:

**Primary Dataset:**
- Global Power Plant Database

**Secondary Datasets:**
- Employment data: US Bureau Labor Statistics
- CO2 Emissions data: Fifth Assessment Report - IPCC

#### Normalization:

**Step 1:** Data was initially in First Normal Form (1NF) :
- Ensured atomic values
- Ensure no repeating groups

**Step 2:** Transformation to Second Normal Form (2NF) :
- Removal of partial functional dependencies
  
**Step 3:** Transformation to Third Normal Form (3NF) :
- Removal of transitive functional dependencies
