# Global-Power-Plant-Database

## Data Overview
- **34,937 records** of **164 countries**.
-   **72%** of the world’s electricity generation capacity

Each record contains:
- **Power plant details** (2013 to 2019):
-   geolocations
-   energy source
-   plant capacity
-   yearly actual and estimated energy generation
-   ownership

**Data Quality**

A significant disparity exists in global energy reporting standards. While **over 90% of U.S. power plants report energy generation data**, this figure drops to **less than 50%** in many other countries. This inconsistency limits the accuracy of cross-country comparisons and hinders effective global energy policy-making. Improving data transparency and standardizing reporting practices are crucial for more reliable insights into worldwide electricity generation and emissions. As a result, only U.S.A. data was analyzed.

## Executive Summary
The global energy sector is undergoing a significant transformation: increasing focus on renewable energy sources and sustainable practices. 

**Goal:** To provide data-driven insights that support renewable energy investment, emission compliance, and economic impact analysis for informed decision-making by energy stakeholders.

## Business-Use Cases
- **Identify regions leading in adding renewable energy sources over the past few years** to get policymakers to replicate successful strategies in other areas and allocate resources more effectively.

- **Identify fuel types with the highest CO₂ emissions** to strategize on transitioning to cleaner, low-emission alternatives.

- **Analyze the economic contribution of power plants by fuel type in terms of employment:**

### Report Query 2: Emissions Compliance Monitoring

```sql
SELECT
    pp.power_plant_id,
    c.country_code,
    eg.generation_year,
    ft.fuel_type,
    ROUND(ce.kg_CO2_per_gwh * eg.actual_generation_gwh, 4) AS emmissions
FROM co2_emissions ce
    JOIN fuel_type ft ON ft.fuel_type_id = ce.fuel_type_id
    JOIN power_plant pp ON pp.fuel_type_id = ft.fuel_type_id
    JOIN country c ON c.country_id = pp.country_id
    JOIN electricity_generation eg ON pp.power_plant_id = eg.power_plant_id
WHERE
    c.country_code = 'USA'
      AND ROUND(ce.kg_CO2_per_gwh * eg.actual_generation_gwh, 4) != 0
ORDER BY
    emmissions DESC;
```

### Report Query 3: Economic Impact by Fuel Type

```sql
SELECT
    YEAR(e.date) AS year,
    SUM(e.total_employees) AS total_employees_per_fuel_type,
    ft.fuel_type
FROM
    employee e
JOIN fuel_type ft ON ft.fuel_type_id = e.fuel_type_id
GROUP BY
    year,
    ft.fuel_type
ORDER BY
    year DESC;
```

    (SUM(e.total_women_employees) / SUM(e.total_employees)) * 100 AS percentage_female_employees,
    100 - (SUM(e.total_women_employees) / SUM(e.total_employees)) * 100 AS percentage_male_employees,
    f.fuel_type
FROM
    employee e
INNER JOIN fuel_type f ON e.fuel_type_id = f.fuel_type_id
GROUP BY
    e.fuel_type_id,
